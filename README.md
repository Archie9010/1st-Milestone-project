# Beautiful Castles 

Welcome to [Beautiful Castles](https://archie9010.github.io/1st-Milestone-project/) A website created with the goal of giving the reader a simple and direct insight to Castles. As most of them are ancient buildings, they are sometimes difficult to visit, so I hope this might be useful for anyone interested in them or just looking to read about them.This website is designed to help people find information about Castles around the Europe. It has pictures and short descriptions of castles, as well as historical facts and external links to other websites for more information.
