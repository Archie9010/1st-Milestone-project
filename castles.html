        <h2>Buckingham Palace</h2>
          <div>
              <p>
                Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom.
                 Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. 
                 It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.
                 Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham 
                 in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private
                 residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects 
                 John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the 
                 British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th
                  centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the British royal family traditionally congregates 
                  to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; the Queen's Gallery was built on the site and 
                  opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.

            <h2>Château de Chenonceau</h2>
              <div>
                  <p>
                     The Château de Chenonceau is a French château spanning the river Cher, near the small village of 
                     Chenonceaux, Indre-et-Loire, Centre-Val de Loire. It is one of the best-known châteaux of the Loire Valley.
                     The estate of Chenonceau is first mentioned in writing in the 11th century. The current château was built in 1514–1522
                     on the foundations of an old mill and was later extended to span the river. 
                     The bridge over the river was built (1556-1559) to designs by the French Renaissance architect Philibert 
                     de l'Orme, and the gallery on the bridge, built from 1570 to 1576 to designs by Jean Bullant.

                      <div>
                          <p>
                            Neuschwanstein Castle (German: Schloss Neuschwanstein, Southern Bavarian: Schloss Neischwanstoa) 
                            is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany. 
                            The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay 
                            for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. 
                            Construction began in 1869, but was never fully completed. The castle was intended as a private residence for the King, 
                            until he died in 1886. It was open to the public shortly after his death. Since then more than 61 million people 
                            have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in 
                            the summer.
